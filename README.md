# SolidStarter

My solid start project starter template because I am spending too much time on this shit.
Kinda opinionated, use it to your own likings.

## Prerequisite

- IDK, node >= 22?
- I use pnpm, if you use others, just make sure to configure your post installation script

## Setup

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm db:migrate`
3. `pnpm dev`

Remember to create your own .env, the types are in env.d.ts

## Stack

- SolidStart + Vinxi
- Tailwind v4
- KobalteUI + SolidUI + Lucide icon
- Modular forms
- Sqlite + Drizzle
